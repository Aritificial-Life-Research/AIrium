# AIrium

This project aims to build an interactive simple artificial life simulation that uses genetic algorithm and fitness evaluation to improve, over different generations, the performance of the agents.

### Controls

- __+__ and __-__ control the zoom of the camera
- __arrow keys__ allow you to move the camera
- __P__ pauses the simulation
- __L__ toggles the frame limiter, allowing the simulation to run as fast as possible

## Development

__AIrium is still a prototype. It works but the interface is non-existant, it's not well optimized and results may vary.__ To work on the project or try it out, install __Netbeans__ and follow _Libgdx_'s guide to set it up for Libgdx development (mobile platform are ignored for now so you won't need the Android SDK). It should be possible to work on the project without using Netbeans, but further explanation is out of the scope of this document (follow Libgdx's wiki).
